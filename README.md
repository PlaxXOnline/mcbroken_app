## About

Haven't you ever driven to a McDonalds on a hot summer day with a craving for ice cream? Or a McFlurry?

Yes?

Then one or the other of these trips was probably completely wasted because the ice cream machine was broken, right?

With this app, that's guaranteed not to happen again.
With the brilliant idea of [Rashiq](https://github.com/rashiq) to develop an API that programmatically checks if the ice machine of McDonalds is working, all these unnecessary empty trips are passe√©.
Rashiq only had a website available at the time of development, so I thought I'd give this project a cross platform app.
